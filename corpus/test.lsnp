Go to the website of the community college you mentioned and find the information for what their Associate Degree Nursing (ASN) program requires., If the college requires chemistry as part of their ASN degree, then you need to take it in college and earn college credits for it., Your high school classes do not count for college., You must take what is required for the degree in college., High school chemistry and college chemistry are two different things., Same with any other requirements for the degree., As far as needing more classes at a university.only if you want to earn a Bachelor of Science in Nursing., Otherwise, the successful completion of an Associate Degree in Nursing program will make you eligible to take the NCLEX and become an RN (it's the same test for grads of an ASN, BSN, and 3-year Diploma program)., An RN is an RN., You don't need 4 years of a foreign language, (at least for community college)., See what the university you are interested in requires for admissions., Again, each school is different., An LPN program takes about a year, going full time., LPNs are being phased out of the hospitals and even those hospitals that still use them have them in areas like Med/Surg., You won't find them in areas like Emergency, OB, Pediatrics, ICUs, etc)., Most LPNs work in nursing homes., Unless your academic ability necessitates you go through a Practical Nursing program first, I would recommend that you go for the Associate Degree at your local community college or a BSN program at a state university., Contact an advisor at the community college; each college is different and they will be able to give you the specifics for their program., Salaries for nurses vary so much it's hard to give an accurate answer without knowing where you live in the US (California, the Midwest, the South, NYC/Boston, etc)., Things like that will also vary with what kind of facility you are working in, what shifts, etc., If it helps: Most new grad RNs start off in the Midwest at around $22-26 an hour base pay, regardless of what degree they have., A BSN will only get you about 50 cents more an hour than if you have an ASN or the 3 year Diploma in Nursing., Obviously if you are on evening or night shift, you will make a few dollars more each hour, and if you are working weekends, that will also get a few more dollars each hour, too.

Many reasons., I worked as a CNA then a EMT for several years while going to college, and met a lot of career CNAs and LVNs at that time., The biggest problem is that many of these workers depend on that income to pay the bills., While low income workers do qualify for financial aid, there is no financial assistance to pay the rent & the sitter while you are off to college for 4 years., Also, some people just aren't keen on college and struggle with homework., CNAs and LVN is vocational training that can be done in a short amount of time., There also is the aspect of patient care., I remember one LVN telling me that being an RN meant too much paper work -- whereas LVNs and CNAs could spend more time actively taking care of patients., Finally, being a LVN or CNA means that you aren't put in a management position ie the "charge nurse.", For some people, that's OK because they don't want that level of responsibility.

I think you're a little confused about how the prerequisites look in the nursing page at GPC: http://www.gpc.edu/programs/AS-Nursing You need to earn 35 credit hours of general ed and prereqs and 36 hours of nursing credits., That's pretty much standard for any ASN program., All Associate Degree programs for any major take about 65-70 credit hours., A Bachelor Degree in any field is around 120-130 hours., So, Emory's BSN program is about right with their requirements., The first 2 years of all BSN programs are the general ed/liberal arts requirements that encompass any Bachelor Degree., The last two years are nursing., What most people don't realize is that an ASN is really 2.5 years in length, including summer courses., EDIT EDIT EDIT: Okay, let's try looking at it like this: To be eligible to take the NCLEX to become an RN, you need to have successfully completed "nurse's training" from one of 3 routes; the 2 most common ways are the ASN (usually through a community college such as GPC) and the BSN (like what Emory and other universities offer)., The third route is through a hospital-based Diploma program (that's what nurses did prior to the 1970's) Now, each of those 3 routes have the same components of nursing needed to become an RN., The Diploma program essentially contains science and pharmacology (for nurses) courses, along with actual nursing., The ASN steps it up by adding general ed courses such as English Comp, Speech, Algebra, Sociology, Psychology, etc,(the general ed components of an Associate Degree) along with the science and nursing courses., Finally, the BSN takes it further by adding liberal arts courses, plus some nursing management and research courses to the plan, providing what some feel is the most "well-rounded" of the 3 options to become an RN., Those 3 options are equal in the amount of clinicals.that's why all 3 lead to the same NCLEX and the awarding of the title of RN., A BSN will require certain general ed classes and liberal arts classes that the ASN (or any AS degree) doesn't., That's why it takes longer to earn a BSN than an ASN (in theory)., Hope that helps.

I don't think you understand the requirements for becoming a Medical Doctor or a Nurse Practitioner., You are fascinated with the idea of a title and have no clue what is involved with either career, so let's take a look at what's required for both: To become a Medical Doctor, you need an undergrad degree with strong math and science components: something like a Bachelor of Science in Biology or Chemistry is optimal., With an undergrad such as that, you will meet the admission requirements for Med School and have the knowledge to score well on the MCAT (which is a big part of being admitted to Med School)., A nursing undergrad degree (the BSN) does not contain the math and science needed for admission or a good MCAT score., After being admitted to Med School, you will have 4 years of constant classes and studying., Students do not work while in Med School- they rely on student loans (and parents) for paying any costs of living., So working as a nurse (or anything else) in Med School is out of the question., You won't have time., After 4 years of college and 4 years of Med School, you need to do a residency., That's where you spend 3-4 years focusing on your area of specialty., After that, you do 1-2 years of a fellowship., With any MD career, you will find that you will either be working something other than 9-5 at some point and there will be times that you'll have to take call., As far as being a Nurse Practitioner.you start off with a BSN, then you work in an area related to what you want to become an Advance Practice Nurse in for a few years., It's usually a minimum of 2 years working as an RN before applying to a NP program., Now keep in mind that to become a Nurse Practitioner after 2015 will require you to earn the DNP- Doctor of Nursing Practice, so you are looking into at least 9 years from the start of your first freshman college class until you have finished to the DNP before you can become a Nurse Practitioner., Given all of what you've just been informed of, I would suggest you start looking into another career field., 9-14 years of education and at least $150,000 in student loans seem a little out of touch if you only want to go into a field so you can call yourself "doctor".

"Criminal Pathologist" isn't really a term that's frequently used in the world outside of TV., You have pathologists of various kinds and one subspeciality is a forensic pathologist., A Pathologist is a doctor, so it's 4 years undergrad, 4 years med school, 4-5 year residency, 1-3 years fellowship(s)., Competition is great since there are far less forensic pathologists postitions than there are other medical positions and the success of all the CSI and Police procedural shows have created an explosion in any type of criminal investigation tech market., Something to keep in mind is that if you are interested in this because of a TV show, that's great, but TV is TV., Pathologists do not typically question suspects., They do not give a COD or even a patient history at the crime scene., Murder only makes up about 6 of every 100,000 deaths (according to CDC statistics), so if you are an ME who has training in Forensic Pathology, you will not be dealing with the flashy murders on a daily basis., http://web2.iadfw.net/uthman/forensic_career.html

Where are you getting this information from., A BSN takes 4 years, an RN usually two., But it depends on the position, the hospital, and if nurses are union in the state as to the pay., An RN and BSN could do all the same stuff as say a med-surg nurse, but a BSN nurse could likely teach RN courses at a 2 year college where an RN wouldn't., Usually those who get a BSN become nurse managers, go onto teach, or continue their training in a specialty area where they get additional certification and end up practicing on their own as an ARNP or midwife.
